    "Representative Samples:\n",

    "Minimizing Bias:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random selection reduces the likelihood of selecting individuals who are atypical or who share specific characteristics.\n",
    "This helps to avoid systematic errors that can distort the results. \n",
    "Statistical Inference:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random sampling allows us to use statistical techniques to calculate confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests. \n",
    "These techniques enable us to quantify the uncertainty in our estimates and make probabilistic statements about the population. \n",
    "Generalizability:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a sample is truly random, we can generalize the findings from the sample to the larger population with a certain degree of confidence. \n",
    "This allows us to draw broader conclusions and make informed decisions. \n",
    "Types of Random Sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Random Sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected. \n",
    "This is the most basic form of random sampling. \n",
    "Stratified Random Sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "The population is divided into subgroups (strata), and a random sample is drawn from each stratum. \n",

    "Cluster Random Sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "The population is divided into clusters, and a random sample of clusters is selected. \n",
    "All individuals within the selected clusters are included in the sample. \n",
    "Systematic Random Sampling:\n",
    "\n",

    "Covariance: The positive covariance of 50 indicates that ice cream sales and temperature tend to move in the same direction. As the temperature increases, ice cream sales also tend to increase.\n",
    "Correlation: The correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship between ice cream sales and temperature. This means that there is a strong, direct relationship between the two variables.'''"
